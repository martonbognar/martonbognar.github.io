<h3>thecookiefactory.org - <a href='http://thecookiefactory.org'>Website</a> - <a href='http://github.com/thecookiefactory/thecookiefactoryorg'>Source code</a></h3>
<p>
This website was (is being) built to showcase maps made for TF2 in a shiny environment, but the possibility is always there to use the website for other purposes as well.
