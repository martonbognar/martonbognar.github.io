<p>
I am a hungarian full time high school student with an interest in anything regarding web development and basically any kind of programming.
</p>
<p>
It probably would not be too much of a lie to say that I have some experience with HTML, CSS and PHP, and I have used Python and Free Pascal (lol) in the past (see my GitHub profile for examples).
</p>
<p>
In the future I am looking to get a degree in either Computer Science or Computer Engineering, but gun to my head I really would like to drop out of college to create something memorable like so many people before me.
